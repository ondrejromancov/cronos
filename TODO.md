# TODO

## Installation
- [x] Make installation of this program easy (Homebrew cask + GitHub releases)

## Claude Integration
- [x] Make the app Claude-oriented by default - run Claude commands with UI for different parameters, with advanced mode for arbitrary bash commands

## Shell Configuration
- [x] Allow different shells (e.g., Zsh, Fish) instead of only Bash

## Reliability
- [x] Ensure failed scheduled jobs are runnable again on the next scheduled time
