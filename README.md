### Build from Source

**macOS App:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ondrejromancov/chronos.git
cd chronos
xcodebuild -project Cronos.xcodeproj -scheme Cronos -configuration Release
```

**Raycast Extension:**

```

## Usage

Click the clock icon in the menu bar to open the job list.

### Managing Jobs

- **Add a job** — click `+` to create a new scheduled command
- **View details** — click any job to expand its detail panel
- **Run now** — trigger a job immediately
- **Enable/disable** — toggle jobs without deleting them
- **Edit/delete** — modify or remove existing jobs

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| ↑/↓ | Navigate between jobs |
| Enter | Expand/collapse job details |
| Escape | Clear search or close panel |

### Logs

Each job shows a preview of the last log line. Click "Logs" to open the full log history:

- View all past runs (newest first)
- See duration, exit code, and timestamp for each run
- Switch between stdout and stderr tabs
- Live streaming while jobs run

### Storage

Jobs and logs are stored locally:

```
~/.cronos/
├── jobs.json          # Job configurations
└── logs/              # Per-run log files
    ├── {runId}.stdout
    └── {runId}.stderr
```

## Raycast Extension

Manage your Cronos jobs directly from Raycast.

### Commands

- **List Jobs** — View all scheduled jobs, run them, toggle enable/disable, or delete
- **Create Job** — Create a new scheduled command

### Installation

The extension reads from the same `~/.cronos/jobs.json` file as the menu bar app, so changes sync automatically.

To install for development:
```bash
cd raycast-extension
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Example

Schedule a Claude CLI command to run daily:

```
Name: Daily Summary
Command: claude -p "summarize today's git commits"
Working Directory: ~/projects/myapp
Schedule: Daily at 9:00
```

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later

## Uninstalling

1. Quit Cronos from the menu bar
2. Delete Cronos.app from Applications
3. Remove data: `rm -rf ~/.cronos`
